# DBGCN-Discord-Bot-GUI-Control-Nextcord
Tkinter GUI that allows users to control the Discord bot without the need in sending messages with the help of IPC (bot commands can be added into the main_bot.py file in order to also make the bot respond via message sending). This uses the Nextcord Library, but soon the other versions will be released.

Please run the main_bot.py file before running the Guimain.py file.
Do NOT delete Gui_2.py file and don't forget to put your bot token at line 230 in main_bot.py.

I apologize for any mistakes or horrible code appeared in those files.
