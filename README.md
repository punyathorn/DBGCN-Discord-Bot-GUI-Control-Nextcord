# Discord-Bot-GUI-Control-Nextcord
Tkinter GUI that allows users to control the Discord bot without the need in sending messages with the help of IPC (You can also add bot commands in the main_bot.py file in order to also make the bot respond via message sending). This uses the Nextcord Library, but soon the Discord.py versions will be released.

SORRY FOR THE HORRIBLE AND MESSY CODE.
